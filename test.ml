(* 10 points: testing. Your source code must include an OUnit test suite
   that the grader can run with a make test command that you provide.
   You are also encouraged to use Bisect, but that is not required. At
   the top of your test file, which should be named test.ml or something
   very similar so that the grader can find it, please write a
   (potentially lengthy) comment describing your approach to testing:
   what you tested, anything you omitted testing, and why you believe
   that your test suite demonstrates the correctness of your system. A
   detailed rubric can be found below. *)

(* The test suite should be runnable with make test. *)

(* -3: The OUnit suite does not have at least 50 passing tests.* *)
(* -5: The OUnit suite does not run with make test, or dies in the
   middle of running. *)
(* -6: There is noply_typeUnit suite. *)

(* * On A2 in a previous semester, the course staff test suite contained
   52 tests. That was the smallest test suite out of all the
   assignments. Students wrote a median of 200 LoC (including tests) to
   solve the assignment. For a project in which 1500-2000 LOC is
   expected, 50 passing tests therefore is a minimal amount. In reality
   we should probably be asking for more, or for Bisect coverage. *)
