In "gui.ml", we used a function copied from the Graphics_image module because 
we couldn't seem to open it in our project. The cited function is 27 lines, and 
should not be counted in our total LOC.

In "test.ml", we used helper functions from A2 to unit test set-like lists.
This block of helper functions at the begining of "test.ml" is written by
Professor Michael Clarkson (mrc26@cornell.edu) and CS 3110 course staff 
at Cornell University. These functions are a total of 19 lines, and should not 
be counted into the total LOC for our final project.

We wrote 80 test cases in 400 lines of codes and thus test.ml 
made up of a huge part of our project, because we believed that constructing 
a stable, maintainable game required careful consideration of different 
components' reciprocal influence. 

Total LOC (counted using cloc --by-file --include-lang=OCaml .): 
    1687 - 27 (gui.ml) - 19 (test.ml) = 1641
