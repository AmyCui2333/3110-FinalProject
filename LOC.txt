20 points: system size. 

As explained in the project handout, I will measure your system size by 
physical LOC. You are welcome to add a file named LOC.txt to your submission 
to explain anything you think I should know about the measurement of your 
system or how you think it should be interpreted. Please do not tell me to 
exclude .ml files because the contain data: you should not be putting data 
into code files. Instead, factor those out into some data file format with a 
different extension such as .csv or .json.
